	    		<h2>Sarcoma in womb found after hysterectomy</h2>
				<br>
				Hi everyone,
				<br>
				<br>
				Only recently found this brilliant site, is there anyone similar to me.
				<br>
				<br>
				I was diagnosed 6 weeks AFTER a total hysterectomy to remove fibroids and was told all clear, then just go a phone call out of the blue, the tests showed sarcoma in the removed womb. Had CT scan, the waiting was horrible to see if it has spread, thankfully it had not.. I felt I had fallen in a black hole and didn't cope very well with the shock and still recovering from the hysterectomy. Anyway taking Aromatase inhibitors and seeing oncoloy/gyne and having scans every 3 months. The oncology/gyne I saw afer the scan was excellent in his matter and explain things in a caring way, but the doctor who prescribed the medication was quite robotic and I just felt he was going through the motions, it completrely upset me and i felt everything was hopeless. Then when I got home the fighting spirit came out and I thought 'I'll show you with your awful manner'. I certainy don want sympathy but his manner was awful.
				<br>
				<br>
				Has anyone come across situations like this?
				<br>
				<br>
				It is helping to be able to 'talk' to others going through and just trying to get on with life.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sending hugs to everyone who reads this.
				<br>
				<br>
				Love mumthumb  X

				Hi Mumthumb
				<br>
				<br>
				Sorry to hear that you've had a bad experience with a doctor who really doesn't understand how to look after a patient holistically.  Sadly there are many great doctors who obviously omitted the compassionate gene in their makeup and perhaps didn't attend any training on it either!  But often they're very good surgeons or specialists so it can be hard to know when/how to complain!
				<br>
				<br>
				I too was diagnosed with a rare sarcoma, cystosarcoma phyllodes and understand that often there is little information to hand or leaflets to refer to or indeed finding others with the same diagnosis.  The apparent lack of understanding and support sometimes feels like too much to bear on your own.  However what I've discovered is the joys of the internet, finding people via their blog entries and online support groups and forums such as this one.  I also attend a support group for sarcoma patients in London (in association with Sarcoma UK).  The next meeting is on Thursday evening.  I'm not sure where you're based but do, if you can, pop along to the meeting.  There are some amazing people who attend, all of whom have been diagnosed or supporting someone with a Sarcoma and lots or rare versions at that, so I'm sure they'll fully empathise and may be able to help.  Sadly I can't be there this month.  I will privately message you the contact details and directions etc.  If you're not in London however there are other support groups that you may find helpful to attend.

				Hi mumthumb
				<br>
				<br>
				If only these doctors realise the damage they do when they are unable to treat vulnerable patients with consideration!  There we are, scared to death, probably not used to hospitals, wondering what will happen next and along comes a member of the medical staff who hasn't any people skills at all (they behave like morons) and because we are so emotional, it has a very deep effect on us.  No, you're not alone, as many on this site will testify but try to see it as his shortcoming not yours.  I've been in the "system" for so long, I find it easy to be very appreciative to staff who treat me well but soon tell others if they are less than caring.  I have to say, I have been very lucky with hospital staff and my own GP practice but I know this isn't the case for everyone.
				<br>
				<br>
				Try not to let this get you down because of a person who obviously needs brushing up on his bedside manner (or perhaps he's in the wrong job!) and I'll glad to hear you've found your fighting spirit again.  I hope someone with your type of cancer comes along for you to exchange experiences but in the meantime, keep coming back as we're all in this together.
				<br>
				<br>
				Love
				<br>
				<br>
				Carrie

				Thanks Carrie for your reply and kind words.
				<br>
				<br>
				The robotic doctor I spoke of in my post told me my sarcoma is very rare as yet I haven t come in contact with anyone, but that would certainly be good to be
				<br>
				<br>
				able to 'speak'to someone in similar position.
				<br>
				<br>
				How ae you getting on?  I hope all is good with you as you sound a very caring person.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have up and down days. I intend to keep positive but feel near to tears, most of the time, which is very unlike me.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sending lots of best wishes and hugs,
				<br>
